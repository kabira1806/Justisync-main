## 📌 The Problem
India's judicial system is overwhelmed with over **4.5 Crore pending cases**. A massive root cause of this delay isn't just the lack of laws, but administrative inefficiencies:
- Manual scheduling leading to overlapping dates.
- Lack of synchronization between Judges' and Lawyers' calendars.
- Zero transparency for the clients/citizens.

## 💡 The Solution: JustiSync
JustiSync is a centralized, digital Case Management platform built on the robust **PERN Stack**. It eliminates administrative bottlenecks by providing a unified ecosystem for Judges, Lawyers, and Clients.

### 🌟 Key Features (Our USP)
- ⚙️ **Smart Conflict Detection Algorithm:** The backend proactively checks for overlapping schedules. It physically prevents a Judge from double-booking a time slot, ensuring 0% scheduling conflicts.
- 🔒 **Role-Based Access Control:** Secure JWT authentication granting specific dashboard access to Judges, Lawyers, and Clients.
- 📅 **Interactive Calendar:** Real-time, asynchronous UI updates powered by React Virtual DOM.
- 🛢️ **Relational Data Integrity:** Built on PostgreSQL to ensure case files and hearing dates are strictly linked and never orphaned.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

1. **Frontend (React.js + Vite):** Role-specific Glassmorphism Dashboards.
2. **Backend (Node.js + Express):** RESTful API handling Auth Middleware and the Conflict Detection Engine.
3. **Database (PostgreSQL):** ACID compliant storage for maximum legal data security.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Run Locally)

Follow these steps to run the JustiSync prototype on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- PostgreSQL & pgAdmin installed

### 1. Database Setup
Open your `pgAdmin`, create a database named `justisync_db`, open the Query Tool, and run the following SQL commands to create the schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE cases (
    case_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pending'
);

CREATE TABLE schedules (
    schedule_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    case_id INT REFERENCES cases(case_id)
);

-- Insert a Dummy Judge for testing
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role) 
VALUES ('Judge Sharma', 'judge@justisync.com', 'password123', 'Judge');
